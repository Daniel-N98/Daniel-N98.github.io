# Copy and Paste Tool

This is a basic website that allows users to easily find, and copy text to their clipboard.<br>
Mainly aimed towards those in a Customer Service position, that frequently receive the same, or <br>
similar customer queries.

### Categories page
This is where all created **categories** will be displayed, as buttons.
The option buttons at the top, allow you to add a new **category**.
When adding a new **category**, the name field is mandatory, but the color is optional.

### Texts page
After clicking a **category** button, the **texts** page will open, and all texts associated with this<br>
**category** will be displayed.
You can edit the **category** name from this screen by using the "Edit Category" button, and delete<br>
a **text** by clicking "Delete".
Clicking "Add New" button will allow you to create a new **text** attached to this **category**.
The "Text Name" & "Text To Copy" are required, and "Button Color" is again optional.




### To Do
  - Allow **Texts** to be renamed [X]
  - Allow **Categories** to be deleted [X]
